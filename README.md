Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the SimpliCare application locally.

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system
	•	Git installed on your system
	•	A Google Gemini API key. You can obtain one by following the instructions on the Google AI Studio page.

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AksharParmar/simplicare.git
cd simplicare


	2.	Create and activate a virtual environment:
	•	On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


	•	On Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not present or needs updating, ensure the following packages are installed:

pip install flask bcrypt google-generativeai python-dotenv


	4.	Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.

	5.	Run the application:

flask run

The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

	•	users.json: Stores user data (for demonstration purposes).

Notes
	•	Ensure that your .env file is not committed to version control to protect your API keys.
	•	The users.json file is used for demonstration and should be replaced with a proper database in a production environment.
